Replace the current content with a description of your app\n* `overview.html`\n* `overview/` – Directory that contains the files for the overview page. This is a different package so you will need to require the component using matte/*.\n  * `main.reel` – The main interface component where you can add the components to show.\n* `node_modules/` – Directory containing all npm packages needed, including Montage. Any packages here must be included as `dependencies` in `package.json` for the Montage require to find them.\n* `test/` – Directory containing tests for your package.\n  * `all.js` – Module that point the test runner to all your jasmine specs.\n* `run-tests.html` – Page to run jasmine tests manually in your browser\n* `testacular.conf.js` – This is the testacular configuration file. You can start testacular by running `node_modules/testacular/bin/testacular start`\n\nCreate the following directories if you need them:\n\n* `locale/` – Directory containing localized content.\n* `scripts/` – Directory containing other JS libraries. If a library doesn’t support the CommonJS \"exports\" object it will need to be loaded through a `<script>` tag.\n\n",
